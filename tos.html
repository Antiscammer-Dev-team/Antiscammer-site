  <h2>1. Description of Service</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Monitor and record all messages sent in a server.</li>
    <li>Detect and automatically ban scammers and known malicious users to protect the community.</li>
    <li>Report scam-related messages for further review.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This bot functions as both a security measure and a moderation tool, specifically targeting scams and fraudulent activities.</p>

  <h2>2. User Responsibilities</h2>
  <p>By adding or using AntiScammer, you agree to:</p>

    <li>Inform your community that messages are monitored and recorded.</li>
    <li>Not misuse the bot to target or harass users unfairly.</li>
    <li>Accept that bans are automated based on scam detection and prior offender records.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>If you disagree with any of these terms, you must remove the bot from your server.</p>

  <h2>3. Data Collection & Privacy</h2>
  <p>All messages in a server using AntiScammer are monitored and recorded.</p>
  <p>Only one authorized individual has access to these recorded messages.</p>
  <p>The data is used exclusively for scam detection and moderation and is not shared with third parties.</p>
  <p>Logs are retained for security purposes and are not sold, distributed, or made public.</p>

  <p>The bot owners reserve the right to review, override, or manually enforce bans as needed.</p>

  <h2>5. Liability & Disclaimer</h2>
  <p>AntiScammer is provided "as-is" without any guarantees of accuracy or uptime.</p>
  <p>We are not responsible for unintended bans, missed scams, or misuse by server admins.</p>
